# dtrt

This LaTeX package will Do The Right Thing, as defined ad hoc by its author and implemented in arbitrarily kludgy ways. At the moment this includes:
* Author and margin-note macros that can be easily turned off globally, marked as "done" or "later", etc.
* Local formatting macros (e.g., a single-paragraph header that automatically adds the ending period if needed).
* Improved hyperlinks, references and TOC for several popular stylesheets.
* Page formatting tweaks.
* "Camera ready" mode that turns off all tweaks and notes.

For more details, see the comments at the top of [dtrt.sty](dtrt.sty).

Tracked [on GitHub](https://github.com/leisec/dtrt). Corrections and improvements are welcome.
