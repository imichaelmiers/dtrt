# dtrt

This LaTeX package will Do The Right Thing, as defined ad hoc by its author and implemented in arbitrarily kludgy ways. At the moment this includes:
* Author and margin-note macros
* Page formatting tweaks
* Local formatting macros
* Improved hyperlinks, references and TOC

This Git repo is private, and is meant to be used by the author collaborators.
